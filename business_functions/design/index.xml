      <description>Overview The Threat Assessment (TA) practise is focused on identifying and understanding the risks that your software may pose towards the organisation. Indeed, software assurance is all about identifying risks in applications and treating them accordingly.
Risks to an application can be relative to the business of the application (think about business logic attacks) or to the technical setup of the application. The Risk Profile stream deals with the former, while the Threat Modeling focuses on the latter.</description>

      <description>Overview     A: Software Requirements B: 3-rd Party Requirements     Maturity 1 - Consider security explicitly during the software requirements process. High-level application security objectives Evaluate the supplier according on security   Maturity 2 - Increase granularity of security requirements derived from business logic and known risks. Requirements from policies, threats, risks, ï¿½ Build security into supplier agreements   Maturity 3 - Mandate security requirements process for all software projects and third-party dependencies.</description>

      <description>Overview     A: Secure Architecture Design B: Technology Management     Maturity 1 - Insert consideration of proactive security guidance into the software design process. Identify basic design principles Elicit technologies, frameworks and integrations within the overall solution   Maturity 2 - Direct the software design process toward known- secure services and secure-by-default designs. Standardize design patterns and security solutions Standardize technologies and frameworks to be used throughout the different applications   Maturity 3 - Formally control the software design process and validate utilization of secure components.</description>
